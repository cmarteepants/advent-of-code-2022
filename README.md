# Constance's Advent of Code 2022

## Overview

These are my answers to the Advent of Code challenge. A new problem is presented each day through the month of December to be solved programmatically. 
The prgram can be written in any language using any tools you like. Each day is split into a Part 1 and a Part 2, and a start is awarded for completing 
each challenge. If you get 50 stars, you save Christmas!

- All problems will be solved using python
- Solutions are not as thoroughly documented as I would like, but this is a fun coding challenge and consistent participation is the goal this year!
- Each day gets its own folder. Folder contains input data, and a module for the solution

## What is Advent of Code?
An awesome coding challenge created by Eric Wastl, released every December. Some problems are trivial and can be solved quickly; others are a PITA. 
Typically, the problems get harder as the month progresses. Please see the link for more information: https://adventofcode.com/
